### Expected Behavior

All participants in our events and communications are expected to show
respect and courtesy to others. All interactions should be professional
regardless of platform: either online or in-person. In order to foster a
positive and professional learning environment we encourage the
following kinds of behaviours in all DSCI 532 Group 02 events and
platforms:

-   Use welcoming and inclusive language
-   Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences
-   Gracefully accept constructive criticism
-   Focus on what is best for the community
-   Show courtesy and respect towards other community members

### Unacceptable Behavior

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants at any DSCI 532 Group
02 event/platform include:

-   written or verbal comments which have the effect of excluding people
    on the basis of membership of any specific group
-   causing someone to fear for their safety, such as through stalking,
    following, or intimidation
-   violent threats or language directed against another person
-   the display of sexual or violent images
-   unwelcome sexual attention
-   nonconsensual or unwelcome physical contact
-   sustained disruption of talks, events or communications
-   insults or put downs
-   sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or exclusionary
    jokes
-   excessive swearing
-   incitement to violence, suicide, or self-harm
-   continuing to initiate interaction (including photography or
    recording) with someone after being asked to stop publication of
    private communication without consent

### Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Participants who are asked to stop any inappropriate behavior are
expected to comply immediately. This applies to any DSCI 532 Group 02
events and platforms, either online or in-person. If a participant
engages in behavior that violates this code of conduct, the teaching
team may warn the offender and or engage the DSCI 532 Instructor to
investigate the Code of Conduct violation and impose appropriate
sanctions.
